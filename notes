Chomsky hierarchy
----------------

  grammars
  --------
  Type-0  | all formal grammars. Can be recognized by a Turing machine | aka recursively enumerable or Turing-recognizable
  Type-1  | generate context-sensitive languages
  Type-2  | generate context-free languages. Can be recognized by a non-deterministic pushdown automaton.   its subset of deterministic context-free languageâ€”are the theoretical basis for the phrase structure of most programming languages, though their syntax also includes context-sensitive name resolution due to declarations and scope. Often a subset of grammars is used to make parsing easier, such as by an LL parser.
  Type-3  | generate "regular languages"
  
 Regular languages
 -----------------
 
     A regular language in the strict sense of the latter notion used in theoretical computer science
     (as opposed to many regular expressions engines provided by modern programming languages, which are augmented
     with features that allow recognition of languages that cannot be expressed by a classic regular expression). 

LL Parser
---------

  LL Parser includes both the recursive descent parser and non-recursive descent parser.
  Its one type uses backtracking while another one uses parsing table. Theses are top down parser.
     
LL vs LR
--------
  first letter (L) stands for Left to right
  second letters (L or R) stands for 'leftmost derivation' or 'rightmost derivation'
  
  LL                                               LR
  constructed in top down                          bottom up
  non-terminals are expanded.                      are compressed
  Starts with the start symbol(S).                 ends with start symbol
  Ends when stack used becomes empty.              Starts with empty stack
  Pre-order traversal of the parse tree.           Post-order traversal of the parser tree.
  Terminal is read after popping out of stack.  	 Terminal is read before pushing into the stack.
  It may use backtracking or dynamic programming.  It uses dynamic programming.
  LL is easier to write.                           LR is difficult to write.
  examples: LL(0), LL(1)                           LR(0), SLR(1), LALR(1), CLR(1)

****

LL(1) is what you need to build a recursive-descent parser. 


***

LR(1) means that you can choose proper rule to reduce by knowing all tokens that will be reduced plus one token after them.
There are no problems with AND in boolean queries and in BETWEEN operation. The following grammar, for example is LL(1), and thus is LR(1) too:

   expr ::= and_expr | between_expr | variable
   and_expr ::= expr "and" expr
   between_expr ::= "between" expr "and" expr
   variable ::= x
   
I believe that the whole SQL grammar is even simpler than LR(1). Probably LR(0) or even LL(n).
